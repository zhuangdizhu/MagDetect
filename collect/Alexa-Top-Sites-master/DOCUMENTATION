This script downloads the alexa top 1M sites CSV, which is a zip archive, 
unarchives it and extracts the top N (defaulting to 100) items.

The primary method is `alexa.top_list(n)` which lists the top n sites in the
following format: [(1, site), (2, site), ..., (n, site)] a list of tuples
where each tuple is a rank, site pair.

Powering this is a generator alexa_etl which initially downloads the zip file,
unzip's it and extracts the ranks.

This process is slow, and is meant for batch jobs to be cached locally rather
than accessed directly via a web page.
